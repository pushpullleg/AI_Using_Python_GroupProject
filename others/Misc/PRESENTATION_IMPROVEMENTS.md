# Presentation Improvement Brainstorming Notes

## User's Feedback
- Current presentation focuses too heavily on "data leakage as a problem to fix"
- Should treat temporal validation as the methodology itself
- Should feel like a complete project presentation, not a fix story
- Still acknowledge data leakage, but as part of methodology discussion
- Need to align with rubric: clear research question, logical sequence, well-presented results

## Key Changes Needed

### 1. Title Slide
**Current**: "Addressing Data Leakage in Machine Learning Models"
**Better**: Focus on the prediction problem and methodology

### 2. Problem Statement (Slide 2)
**Current**: Leads with "The Risk: Data Leakage"
**Better**: Lead with the prediction challenge, mention methodological rigor as context

### 3. Remove/Reframe "What is Data Leakage?" Slide
**Current**: Dedicated slide explaining data leakage
**Better**: Integrate into methodology section or remove entirely - it's a methodological consideration, not the main problem

### 4. Temporal Validation Slide
**Current**: "The Fix: Split data by TIME"
**Better**: "Temporal Validation Methodology" - present as the approach

### 5. Feature Engineering
**Current**: "14 Leak-Free Features"
**Better**: "14 Temporal Features" or "14 Historically-Derived Features" - positive framing

### 6. Key Findings
**Current**: Leads with "Data leakage prevention is critical"
**Better**: Lead with results and insights, mention methodology rigor as supporting factor

## Proposed Structure

1. **Title**: Prediction Problem + Methodology
2. **Problem Statement**: The prediction challenge for NCAA programs
3. **Research Question**: Clear statement
4. **Data Overview**: What we're working with
5. **Methodology**: Temporal validation approach (including how we ensured rigor)
6. **Feature Engineering**: Our approach
7. **Model Selection**: Why these models
8. **Results**: Performance metrics
9. **Baseline Comparison**: Context for results
10. **Visualizations**: Key insights
11. **2023 Predictions**: Real-world application
12. **Key Findings**: What we learned
13. **Limitations & Future Work**: Honest assessment
14. **Conclusions**: Takeaways
15. **Q&A**: References and questions

## Tone Shifts
- From: "We had a problem, we fixed it"
- To: "We used proper methodology to solve this prediction problem"
- From: "Data leakage is dangerous"
- To: "Temporal validation ensures realistic predictions"
