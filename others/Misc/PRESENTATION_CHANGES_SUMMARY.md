# Presentation Reframing - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Reframed the presentation from a "fixing data leakage" narrative to a methodology-focused presentation about temporal validation for time series prediction.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Title Slide (Slide 1)
**Before**: "Addressing Data Leakage in Machine Learning Models"
**After**: "A Machine Learning Approach with Temporal Validation"
- Focuses on the methodology and prediction problem
- Removes the "fixing a problem" framing

### 2. Problem Statement (Slide 2)
**Before**: 
- Led with "The Risk: Data Leakage"
- Positioned as avoiding pitfalls

**After**:
- Clear research question explicitly stated
- Focuses on the prediction challenge
- Mentions methodology as "our approach" not "our solution"

### 3. Removed Standalone Data Leakage Slide
**Before**: Slide 3 dedicated entirely to explaining data leakage
**After**: Slide 3 reframed as "Why Temporal Validation?" 
- Explains temporal validation as the methodology
- Data leakage mentioned as a consideration, not the focus
- Includes literature support (Bergmeir & Benítez, Tashman)

### 4. Temporal Validation Methodology (Slide 5)
**Before**: "The Fix: Split data by TIME, not randomly"
**After**: "Our Approach: Chronological Data Splitting"
- Framed as methodology, not a fix
- Emphasizes principles rather than problem avoidance

### 5. Feature Engineering (Slide 6)
**Before**: "14 Leak-Free Features"
**After**: "14 Historically-Derived Features"
- Positive framing (what we built)
- "Design Philosophy" section instead of "what we avoided"

### 6. Key Findings (Slide 12)
**Before**: Led with "Data leakage prevention is critical"
**After**: Led with results and insights
- Findings about temporal validation and results first
- Methodology rigor mentioned as supporting factor

### 7. Conclusions (Slide 14)
**Before**: "Built prediction system with proper temporal validation"
**After**: "Developed machine learning system... Implemented temporal validation methodology"
- More comprehensive accomplishment list
- Emphasis on development and implementation

### 8. References
**Before**: Lead reference was "Data leakage in ML"
**After**: Lead references are methodology-focused (time series validation)
- More aligned with the reframed narrative

### 9. Speaker Notes
- Updated role divisions to reflect new slide organization
- Updated timing guide (removed one slide, redistributed time)

## Narrative Shift

### Before (Problem-Fix Narrative):
1. "We have a prediction problem"
2. "But watch out - data leakage is dangerous!"
3. "Here's what data leakage is..."
4. "We fixed it with temporal validation"
5. "Here are our results"

### After (Methodology-Focused Narrative):
1. "We have a prediction problem"
2. "Here's our research question"
3. "Temporal validation is the right methodology for time series"
4. "Here's how we implemented it"
5. "Here are our results using this methodology"

## Alignment with Rubric

✅ **Research Question Clearly Defined**: Now explicit in Slide 2
✅ **Logical Sequence**: Flows from problem → methodology → implementation → results
✅ **Well-Organized**: Removed tangential data leakage slide, integrated concepts
✅ **Main Topics Clearly Defined**: Prediction problem and temporal validation methodology

## What Stayed the Same (Good Content Preserved)

- All results slides (8-11) - excellent content maintained
- All methodology details
- All predictions and findings
- All limitations and future work
- Data overview and model selection

## Tone Improvements

- More professional and academic
- Focuses on what you built, not what you avoided
- Positions temporal validation as best practice, not a fix
- Maintains authenticity of the work done
